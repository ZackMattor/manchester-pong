# manchester-pong
This codebase consists of the frontent and backend code required to run and host an interactive Pong Game for public spaces. It is written in NodeJS with the VueJS framework and uses websockets to stream the controls to the display screen.

It was originaly started to celibrate the life of [Ralph H. Baer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_H._Baer) who is considered "the Father of Video Games". He was born March 8, 1922 in Rodalben, Palatinate, Germany and was an avid inventor and tinkerer. Just before WWII he fled to the United States and settled in Manchester NH where he started playing around with video game technologies. One of his inventions was the arcade clasic "Table Tennis" which was later called "Pong" which is what the inspiriation for the game here came from.

The Idea for this version of Pong was for people walking down the streets of manchester to jump in and play a game of Pong with a friend. We wanted to put a large screen in a window and allow people able to walk by and use their phones to connect to the game and start playing.
